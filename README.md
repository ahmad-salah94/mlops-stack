# Optimizing the Model Lifecycle in Machine Learning through MLOps-enabled Automation Techniques

## About the Master's Thesis
This master's thesis at Reutlingen University, submitted by Ahmad Salah, focuses on applying MLOps methodologies to optimize the model lifecycle in machine learning. The goal was to design an open-source-based MLOps architecture that facilitates the integration and operationalization of ML models. The results demonstrate how MLOps can contribute to increasing the efficiency and reliability of ML projects.
